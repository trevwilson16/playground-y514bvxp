# Welcome!

This ASP .NET Core Web template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example in ASP .NET Core. If this is your first contribution, you should have a look at the [Getting Started](https://tech.io/doc/getting-started-create-playground) guide.


The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechDotIO/aspnetcore-web-template/), please feel free to come up with proposals to improve it.
